## Tutorial Notebooks

We plan to gradually release tutorials for different downstream tasks, including:

- [x] Cell-type annotation
- [ ] Spatial Imputation
- [ ] scRNA-seq denoising
- [ ] Gene perturbation prediction

We also plan to build a more user-friendly interface for downstream tasks, therefore, the tutorials might be updated from time to time.

## Dataset Preparation

Before running the tutorial, please download datasets from our [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/i5rmxgtqzg7iykt2e9uqm/h?rlkey=o8hi0xads9ol07o48jdityzv1&dl=0) and placed h5ad datasets in the `../data` folder.

All datasets used in our tutorials are collected from previous publications and we provide the references in `../data/README.md`.

## Customized Dataset

Currently we do not provide instructions for customized datasets but we will support it soon.
